### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes
[`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java))
is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API
`interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality
using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given
component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled
to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in
[`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Appointment` objects residing in the
`Model`.

### Logic component

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn
creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a
`Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** :
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list
which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be
bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
`ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores an `observableAppointments` object that represents existing appointments in the address book, sorted in a
chronological order.
* stores a `sortedAppointments` object that represents existing appointments in the address book.
* `observableAppointments` and `sortedAppointments` depend on `filteredPersons`. Hence, appointments listed are for
`Person` objects in `filteredPersons`.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP)
model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook`
to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

This approach is also use for `FinancialPlan`. The multiple `Tag` and `FinancialPlan` objects are stored in their
respective `HashSet` where each object in the `HashSet` will have a corresponding hashcode.

</div>


### Storage component

**API** :
[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Overview 

The basic idea of what happens when a user types a command: 
1. The LogicManager executes method is called and takes in the user's input.
2. The user's input is then parsed by `AddressBookParser`, which then creates the respective `XYZCommandParser`. 
3. `XYZCommandParser` parses the additional arguments provided by the user and creates and `XYZCommand`.
4. `XYZCommand` then communicates with ModelManager to execute and returns a `CommandResult` which is displayed to the user.


The flow of how a `Command` is executed is illustrated with the `Schedule` Command below.
### Schedule Command

#### Implementation Overview
After the `AddressBookParser` identifies that the user's input has a schedule command word, it creates a
`ScheduleCommandParser`. The `ScheduleCommandParser` then parses the users input and creates a new `ScheduleCommand`
containing an `Appointment` and an `Index`. The `ScheduleCommand` is then executed by `Logic Manager`, which updates
the `Person` in `Model` to have the created `Appointment`. A `CommandResult` which stores the message of the outcome
of schedule command is then returned. The partial class diagram is shown below.

<img src="images/ScheduleClassDiagram.png" width="400"/>

The following activity diagram summarises what happens the user executes a schedule command. 

<img src="images/ScheduleActivityDiagram.png" width="400"/>

**Design Considerations**

**Aspect: How to implement Appointments for Person**  

Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Create an abstract class ScheduleItem and make it a compulsory field for Person.

The diagram below illustrates our current implementation. A `Person` has is associated with 1 `ScheduleItem`, which can
be a `NullAppointment`(empty appointment) or `Appointment`. 

<img src="images/ScheduleItemClassDiagram.png" width="300"/> 

- Pros: 
  * This ensures a 1-to-1 relationship between Person and Appointment, making implementation of other functions like
  sort easier. This also prevents clutter of appointments in the UI.
  * This makes use of a **facade** design pattern, where `NullAppointment` and `Appointment` will handle themselves
  without the `Person` knowing. 
  
- Cons: 
  * This makes the scheduling of Appointments more inflexible, as the FA is unable to schedule multiple appointments
  with the same person.

- Other considerations: 
  * `NullAppointment` is a Singleton class to prevent multiple instances of it being created, making it more efficient
  for memory. 

Alternative 2: Create a hashset of Appointments for each Person. 
- Pros:
  * More flexible, user can now schedule multiple appointment for a Person. 
  
- Cons:
  * Harder to implement operations such as editing of an appointment for a client. An additional step of finding the
  specified appointment within the hashset is required, which may potentially introduce more bugs.
  * Harder to implement default behaviours for when person has no appointment.

### Complete Feature

The **Complete** feature is facilitated by the `CompleteCommand` and `CompleteCommandParser`. The
`CompleteCommandParser` creates a `CompleteCommand` associated with a `CompleteCommandDescriptor` which contains
information on how the appointments should be completed.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the complete operation is executed when date given. 

<img src="images/CompleteSequenceDiagram.png" width="800"/>

> :warn: The lifeline of the diagram should end at the destroyer mark (X) but reaches end of diagram due to limitation of plantUML

The following activity diagram illustrates how the complete operation is executed. 

<img src="images/CompleteActivityDiagram.png" width="800"/>

### Gather Emails Feature

The **Gather Emails** feature in our software system is a critical functionality designed to efficiently collect
email addresses. This feature is facilitated through the `GatherCommand` class, which plays a central role in the process.

#### Implementation Overview

The `GatherCommand` class is instantiated by the `GatherCommandParser`, which parses user input commands. The
`GatherCommandParser` class implements the following operations:

* `GatherCommandParser#parse(String args)`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks the prefixes (fp/ and t/) and instantiates `GatherCommand`
accordingly. It passes either a `GatherEmailByFinancialPlan` or a `GatherEmailByTag` object, both implementations of
the `GatherEmailPrompt` interface.

The `GatherCommand` takes in a `GatherEmailPrompt` object and passes it into the current `Model` model, subsequently
interacting with the `AddressBook` and `UniquePersonsList` classes. The `GatherCommand` class implements the following
operations:

* `GatherCommand#GatherCommand(GatherEmailPrompt prompt)`â€‰â€”â€‰Constructor that initializes the command with the
provided `GatherEmailPrompt` object.
* `GatherCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰ Executes the gathering operation by calling
`Model#gatherEmails(GatherEmailPrompt prompt)`.

The `Model` interface is implemented by the `ModelManager`, representing the in-memory model of the address book data.
It contains the following method:

* `ModelManager#gatherEmails(GatherEmailPrompt prompt)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Carries out the gathering operation by calling
`AddressBook#gatherEmails(GatherEmailPrompt prompt)`.

This operation is exposed in the `AddressBook` class as `AddressBook#gatherEmails(GatherEmailsPrompt prompt)`, and
in the `UniquePersonsList` class as `UniquePersonsList#gatherEmails(GatherEmailsPrompt prompt)`.

The `UniquePersonsList` class maintains a list of unique persons. Additionally, it implements the following operation:
* `UniquePersonsList#gatherEmails(GatherEmailPrompt prompt)`â€‰â€”â€‰ This method iterates through the persons list
and calls `GatherEmailPrompt#gatherEmails(Person person)`, passing in each person. 

Depending on the scenario, it triggers either `Person#gatherEmailsContainsTag(String prompt)` or
`Person#gatherEmailsContainsFinancialPlan(String prompt)`:
* `Person#gatherEmailsContainsTag(String prompt)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Checks if the given prompt is a substring of the name of
any Tag in the `Set<Tag>` of the current person.
* `Person#gatherEmailsContainsFinancialPlan(String prompt)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Checks if the given prompt is a substring of the
name of any Financial Plan in the `Set<Tag>` of the current person.

This is the class diagram for the gather command:

![GatherClassDiagram](images/GatherClassDiagram.png)

**Usage Scenario:**

**Scenario 1:**
User enters a gather `fp/financial plan a`. The `GatherEmailByFinancialPlan` will be initialized. Each person in the
`UniquePersonList` will be passed into the `GatherEmailByFinancialPlan#gatherEmails(Person person)`.

**Scenario 2:**
User enters a gather `t/Elderly`. The `GatherEmailByTag` will be initialized. Each person in the `UniquePersonList` will be passed into the `GatherEmailByTag#gatherEmails(Person person)`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the gather operation works:

![GatherSequenceDiagram](images/GatherSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How implement more fields**

**Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** User can only search by one Financial Plan or Tag.
- **Pros:** Easy to implement. Limits the potential for bugs.
- **Cons:** Limited filtering options. Hard to scale to gather by other fields.

**Alternative 2:** User can search by multiple Financial Plans or Tags.
- **Pros:** More filtering options. Easy to scale to gather by other fields.
- **Cons:** Introduces more complexity and requires additional error handling.

### Expanded Find feature

The enhanced find mechanism is facilitated by the `CombinedPredicate` and utilises the existing `FindCommand` structure. 
It extends the `find` command with the ability to search for multiple terms at once, implemented using an array
of `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate`. Here's a partial class diagram of the `CombinedPredicate`.
![CombinedPredicateClassDiagram](images/CombinedPredicateClassDiagram.png)

In the `FindCommandParser`, `CombinedPredicate` is initialised with a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`,
`FinancialPlanContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`. These predicates check a `Person` if the
respective field contains any of the keywords supplied to the predicate.

Note that only `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` checks for whole words, because it is rare to search for people by
substrings e.g. `Marc` and `Marcus` should not show up in the same search. On the other hand,
`FinancialPlanContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` allow matching for
substrings because there are certain cases where it is logical to search for substrings e.g. `Plan A` and
`Plan A Premium` are related, so they can show up in the same search.

The `find` command format also changes to resemble a format more similar to the `add` and `edit` commands, to allow for
searching for keywords in multiple fields at the same time. We also allow the use of duplicate prefixes so that we
can search for multiple terms belonging to the same field.

For now, we only allow for searching for `Name`, `FinancialPlan` and `Tag` fields because they are the most commonly
searched fields, but extending the feature to search in other fields is possible by creating the `Predicate` class and
modifying the `FindCommandParser`.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How to implement find for multiple fields**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use one unified command and format.
    * Pros: Easy to implement (argument multimap is available), allows for more flexible usage.
    * Cons: May get cluttered when there are many terms.

* **Alternative 2:** Take an argument to decide which field to find by.
    * Pros: More user-friendly and natural since there is no need to use prefixes.
    * Cons: Less flexible, slightly more difficult to implement.

**Aspect: How to implement `CombinedPredicate`**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use varargs and a common interface.
    * Pros: More flexible in usage while still testable.
    * Cons: More difficult to modify and the check for equality can be defeated with enough effort.

* **Alternative 2:** Compose it with the 3 component predicates.
    * Pros: Easier to modify and test.
    * Cons: Less flexible when trying to combine multiple predicates (that may be of the same type).

* **Alternative 3:** Use a `Predicate<Person>` and use the `or()` method to chain predicates.
    * Pros: More flexible in usage.
    * Cons: More difficult to modify and test.

### Sort Feature

The **Sort** feature in our software system is designed to sort the list of clients by name as well as appointment time. This feature is facilitated through the `SortCommand` class.

#### Implementation Overview

The `SortCommand` class is instantiated by the `SortCommandParser`, which parses user input commands. The `SortCommandParser` class implements the following operations:

- **`SortCommandParser#parse(String args)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Checks the sort command keyword passed in by the user. 

The `SortCommand` takes in a `Comparator<Person>` object and passes it into the current `Model` model. The `SortCommand` class implements the following operations:

- **`SortCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰ Executes the sort operation by calling `model.sortFilteredPersonList(comparator)`.

The `Model` interface is implemented by the `ModelManager`, representing the in-memory model of the address book data. It contains the following method:

- **`ModelManager#sortFilteredPersonList(Comparator<Person> comparator)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Carries out the sorting operation by setting the comparator on the list of clients wrapped in a SortedList wrapper.

**Aspect: Usage Scenario:**

**Scenario 1:**
User enters a sort command `sort appointment`. The `SortByAppointmentComparator` will be initialized and used to instantiate a SortCommand that when executed causes the list to be sorted by appointment, showing the earlier appointment first.

**Scenario 2:**
User enters a sort command `sort name`. The `SortByNameComparator` will be initialized and used to instantiate a SortCommand that when executed causes the list to be sorted by lexicographical ordering of name.

The following sequence diagram shows how the gather operation works:

<img src="images/SortClassSequenceDiagram.png" width="700"/>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How Sort Executes**

**Aspect 1 :** User can sort by name and appointment at any time. As such, calling find on the sorted list will result in the ordering of find to also be sorted.
- **Pros:** Improved usability of maintaining order of list throughout without the list having to be reordered after each command
- **Cons:** Limited sorting options as of now

**Aspect 2:** After sorting the first time, it will not be possible to return the list to its original ordering
- **Pros:** Easier implementation of the sorting function.
- **Cons:** Unlikely, but if for some reason the user wants the list sorted back to its original order, the only way is to restart the app at the current moment.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_


### Appointment Sidebar Feature

The appointment sidebar is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model` and stores and additional `SortedList<Appointment>` object that represents all the existing appointments.

The `setAppointmentList()` method always check against `filteredPersons` to look for updates regarding existing `Appointment` objects. Tg=he `getAppointmentList()` method is called once during startup of the program by `getAppointmentList()` in `LogicManager`, which is in turn called by `MainWindow`. It returns the `sortedList<Appointment>` object within `modelManager`.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Where to create SortedList<Appointment>**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement it within `modelManager`
    * Pros: `SortedAppointments` object references `filteredPersons` which ensures that the appointment sidebar corresponds with `persons` from `addressBook`.
    * Cons: Errors with respect to `addressBook` will affect the appointment sidebar rendered.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement it within `addressBook`
    * Pros: `persons` and `appointmentList` are handled separately within `addressBook` and hence the appointment sidebar is not dependent on `persons` in `addressBook`
    * Cons: `filteredPersons` and `sortedAppointments` might not correspond since `sortedAppointments` is no longer dependent on `filteredPersons`.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature
#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="400" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with typing speed of above 80WPM for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  A user should be able to have up to 2000 clients.
5.  The product is offered as a free offline service.
6.  The codebase should be well-documented to aid in future maintenance and updates.
7.  Should continue working despite invalid commands and error messages should be shown to the user.
8.  All features added to the code should be tested.
9.  All commands should be able to be executed by a financial advisor with little technical knowledge.

### Planned Enhancements
1. The current `schedule` command does not check if the given date is before the current date, so it is vulnerable to
user error. We plan to make the command check for the date and fail if the date is before the current date: `Date given
 cannot be before the current date`.
2. The current `phone` and `next-of-kin phone` fields currently only accepts numbers. It cannot accept international
number formats. We plan to make the fields accept symbols so numbers such as `+6598765432` and `001-234-1-4610818`
will be accepted. This will involve changing the validity checker for both fields.
3. The current contact book does not check for duplicates beyond the exact matching of the person's `name`.
We plan to refuse adding/editing of a person's details if it results in two people sharing a `name` (case-insensitive)
or `phone` since two people are very unlikely to share those details.
4. The current `name` and `next-of-kin name` fields currently do not accept symbols. We plan to make the fields accept
symbols so that names like `Thaarshen s/o Thaarshen` and `O'Brien` are accepted. This will involve changing the
validity checker for both fields.
5. The current `gather` command does not allow the gathering of all emails in the contact book or by multiple fields
at once. To allow the gathering of all the persons emails using `gather all` command, we plan create another
`GatherEmailPrompt` class, with a method that will call the Person `getEmail()` method. To allow gathering emails
by multiple fields, for example using the `fp/` and `t/` prefixes at once, we plan to use a similar approach 
to `find` but return the person's email instead.
6. The `complete`, `add`, `edit` and `schedule` commands currently display the whole list (i.e. undoes the result of
any `find` command) after being executed, which might cause users to become disoriented. We plan to disable this
interaction between these commands and `find`.
7. The `clear` command confirmation window can be manipulated using the arrow and 'Enter' keys. The window is
initialised with the focus on the `confirm` button. This makes it possible for a user to accidentally press 'Enter'
twice and wipe the contact book anyway, bypassing the defence mechanism entirely. We plan to make the command more
resistant to mistakes by having the user key in a specific phrase, or to initialise the window with the focus on the
`cancel` button instead.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   2. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

3. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   2. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   3. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

2. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_
