### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores a `observableAppointments` object that represents existing appointments in the address book, sorted in a chronological order.
* stores a `sortedAppointments` object that represents existing appointments in the address book.
* `observableAppointments` and `sortedAppointments` depend on `filteredPersons`. Hence, appointments listed are for `Person` objects in `filteredPersons`.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

This approach is also use for `FinancialPlan`. The multiple `Tag` and `FinancialPlan` objects are stored in their respective `HashSet` where each object in the `HashSet` will have a corresponding hashcode.

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Gather Emails Feature

The **Gather Emails** feature in our software system is a critical functionality designed to efficiently collect email addresses. This feature is facilitated through the `GatherCommand` class, which plays a central role in the process.

#### Implementation Overview

The `GatherCommand` class is instantiated by the `GatherCommandParser`, which parses user input commands. The `GatherCommandParser` class implements the following operations:

- **`GatherCommandParser#parse(String args)`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks the prefixes (fp/ and t/) and instantiates `GatherCommand` accordingly. It passes either a `GatherEmailByFinancialPlan` or a `GatherEmailByTag` object, both implementations of the `GatherEmailPrompt` interface.

The `GatherCommand` takes in a `GatherEmailPrompt` object and passes it into the current `Model` model, subsequently interacting with the `AddressBook` and `UniquePersonsList` classes. The `GatherCommand` class implements the following operations:

- **`GatherCommand#GatherCommand(GatherEmailPrompt prompt)`â€‰â€”â€‰Constructor that initializes the command with the provided `GatherEmailPrompt` object.
- **`GatherCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰ Executes the gathering operation by calling `Model#gatherEmails(GatherEmailPrompt prompt)`.

The `Model` interface is implemented by the `ModelManager`, representing the in-memory model of the address book data. It contains the following method:

- **`ModelManager#gatherEmails(GatherEmailPrompt prompt)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Carries out the gathering operation by calling `AddressBook#gatherEmails(GatherEmailPrompt prompt)`.

These operations are exposed in the `AddressBook` class as `AddressBook#gatherEmails(GatherEmailsPrompt prompt)`, and in the `UniquePersonsList` class as `UniquePersonsList#gatherEmails(GatherEmailsPrompt prompt)`.

The `UniquePersonsList` class maintains a list of unique persons. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

- **`UniquePersonsList#gatherEmails(GatherEmailPrompt prompt)`â€‰â€”â€‰ This method iterates through the persons list and calls `GatherEmailPrompt#gatherEmails(Person person)`, passing in each person. Depending on the scenario, it triggers either `Person#gatherEmailsContainsTag(String prompt)` or `Person#gatherEmailsContainsFinancialPlan(String prompt)`.

- **`Person#gatherEmailsContainsTag(String prompt)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Checks if the given prompt is a substring of the name of any Tag in the `Set<Tag>` of the current person.
- **`Person#gatherEmailsContainsFinancialPlan(String prompt)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Checks if the given prompt is a substring of the name of any Financial Plan in the `Set<Tag>` of the current person.

This is the class diagram for the gather command:

<img src="images/GatherClassDiagram.png" width="500"/>

**Aspect: Usage Scenario:**

**Scenario 1:**
User enters a gather `fp/financial plan a`. The `GatherEmailByFinancialPlan` will be initialized. Each person in the `UniquePersonList` will be passed into the `GatherEmailByFinancialPlan#gatherEmails(Person person)`.

**Scenario 2:**
User enters a gather `t/Elderly`. The `GatherEmailByTag` will be initialized. Each person in the `UniquePersonList` will be passed into the `GatherEmailByTag#gatherEmails(Person person)`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the gather operation works:

<img src="images/GatherSequenceDiagram.png" width="700"/>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How Gather Executes**

**Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** User can only search by one Financial Plan or Tag.
- **Pros:** Easy to implement. Limits the potential for bugs.
- **Cons:** Limited filtering options. Hard to scale to gather by other fields.

**Alternative 2:** User can search by multiple Financial Plans or Tags.
- **Pros:** More filtering options. Easy to scale to gather by other fields.
- **Cons:** Introduces more complexity and requires additional error handling.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Expanded Find feature

The enhanced find mechanism is facilitated by the `CombinedPredicate` and utilises the existing FindCommand structure. 
It extends `Predicate<Person>` and is composed of up to one of a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `FinancialPlanContainsKeywordsPredicate`
and a `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` each. Here's a partial class diagram of the `CombinedPredicate`.
![CombinedPredicate](images/CombinedPredicate.png)

The `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `FinancialPlanContainsKeywordsPredicate` and
`TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` check a Person if the respective field contains
any of the keywords supplied to the predicate. Note that only the `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` 
checks for whole words, because it is rare to search for people by substrings, while `FinancialPlanContainsKeywordsPredicate`
and `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` allow matching for substrings because there are certain cases where it is logical to search for
substrings e.g. `Plan A` and `Plan A Premium` are related, so they can show up in the same search.

The Find command format also changes to resemble a format more similar to the `add` and `edit` commands, to allow for
searching for keywords in multiple fields at the same time.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How to implement find for multiple fields**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use one unified command and format.
    * Pros: Easy to implement (argument multimap is available), allows for more flexible usage.
    * Cons: May get cluttered when there are many terms.

* **Alternative 2:** Take an argument to decide which field to find by.
    * Pros: More user-friendly and natural since there is no need to use prefixes.
    * Cons: Less flexible, slightly more difficult to implement.

**Aspect: How to implement `CombinedPredicate`**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Compose it with the 3 component predicates.
    * Pros: Easier to modify and test.
    * Cons: Less flexible when trying to combine multiple predicates (that may be of the same type).

* **Alternative 2:** Use a `Predicate<Person>` and use the `or()` method to chain predicates.
    * Pros: More flexible in usage.
    * Cons: More difficult to modify and test.

### Appointment Sidebar Feature

The appointment sidebar is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It etends `Model` and stores and additional `SortedList<Appointment>` object that represents all the existing appointments.

The `setAppointmentList()` method always check against `filteredPersons` to look for updates with regards to existing `Appointment` objects. Tg=he `getAppointmentList()` method is called once during startup of the program by `getAppointmentList()` in `LogicManager`, which is in turn called by `MainWindow`. It returns the `sortedList<Appointment>` object within `modelManager`.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Where to create SortedList<Appointment>**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement it within `modelManager`
    * Pros: `SortedAppointments` object references `filteredPersons` which ensures that the appointment sidebar corresponds with `persons` from `addressBook`.
    * Cons: Errors with respect to `addressBook` will affect the appointment sidebar rendered.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement it within `addressBook`
    * Pros: `persons` and `appointmentList` are handled separately within `addressBook` and hence the appointment sidebar is not dependent on `persons` in `addressBook`
    * Cons: `filteredPersons` and `sortedAppointments` might not correspond since `sortedAppointments` is no longer dependent on `filteredPersons`.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="400" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
