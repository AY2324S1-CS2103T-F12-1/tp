### Overview

UNOFAS is a desktop app for **Financial Advisors (FA)** to manage clientâ€™s contacts, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. The app also includes features such as sorting, scheduling and other commands to query information quickly required by the FA.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ScheduleItem class as a new field to Person
  * What it does: Ensures that a Person has a 1-to-1 relationship with a ScheduleItem object.
  * Justification: This feature provides users the ability to associate appointments with their clients. 
  * Highlights: An abstract class is used to allow methods to be executed on the person's appointment field without needing to know if it is a null appointment or appointment.
