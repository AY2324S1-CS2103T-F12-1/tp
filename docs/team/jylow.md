### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort list by appointments and lexicographical order
    * What it does: allows the user to perform sorting of list by appointment time and lexicographical order of name.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can more efficiently find clients by name and the proximity of their appointments to view upcoming appointments.
    * Highlights: This enhancement creates a base to implement different sorting capabilities in the future through sorting by new comparators. It required an understanding of ObservableList interface and the way the list is being tracked by JavaFX.
