### Overview

UNOFAS is a desktop app for Financial Advisors (FA) to manage clientâ€™s contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The app also includes features
such as sorting, scheduling and other commands to query information quickly required by the FA.
