### Overview

UNOFAS is a desktop app for Financial Advisors (FA) to manage clientâ€™s contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The app also includes features
such as sorting, scheduling and other commands to query information quickly required by the FA.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added appointment list that shows upcoming appointments of clients in chronological order and wrote tests
    * Justification: Financial advisors may want to view all upcoming appointments easily in chronological order so that it is easier for them to plan their timetables.
    * Highlights: This enhancement creates another UI element to show various other appointment-specific details in the future. It requires an understanding of ObservableList interface and the way the list is being tracked by JavaFX.
